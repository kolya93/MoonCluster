Project description:
MoonCluster is an experimental computer architecture for mobile personal computing. It breaks free from many traditions of computer architecture to deliver unparalleled levels of low-level security and reliability.
MoonCluster will likely be the most secure modern mobile personal computer system, safe from root-level malware such as spyware, ransomware, root-level ACE exploits, trojans, etc..
This is a research system, and as such, most of the work will be documenting the system's general design.
Thus, this project will consist mostly of documentation of the architecture, logs of hardware tests, simulations, and consultation from professors.

Project goals:
The main goal of this project is to make public my experimental ideas behind MoonCluster. 
The other goals include:
- Create a simulation of the system's interface
- Test the system's speed
- Consult a plethora of professors and log their opinions
- Begin official development of the system

At the end of the semester, I will have publicized the ideas behind the architecture, completed a simulation of the system, evaluated the system's usability by testing its speed, collated the opinions of professors, and begun development of the actual system.

Milestones:
Middle of February: formally publicize and document the ideas behind the architecture on GitHub.

End of February: test the system's speed and complete the simulation.

End of March: consult many professors and log their opinions onto GitHub.

End of Semester: begin official development of actual system.
