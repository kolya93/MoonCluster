Note on network card security and cryptoprocessors:

Userspace processes must not have access to the system's private key. 
If they did have access, then a malicious userspace program could send
the private key to the malicious actor. Then of course the malicious actor
could decrypt any intercepted messages encrypted with this private key, 
namely those sent by other userspace processes. This is an unacceptable 
and severe security risk.
It is imperative that MoonCluster user processes have no access to the
user module's private key.


Solution:
Therefore, every MoonCluster user module must have a secure
cryptoprocessor, which is a hardware module that performs encryption
while hiding the private key. On a system with a cryptoprocessor, 
no software, not even the operating system has access to the system's
private key. Thus, MoonCluster programs will never know the system's 
private key.
